So the Project has different 8 different modules their names being Login,Enroll Customer, Daily Update, Bill Generation, Bill Collection, Customer Datail, Payment History,Bill Watcher.

To give a brief idea about the modules:

1. Enroll Customer: This module takes information input of customer subscribing for the milk services and persists them in the                     
                    database for later access.

2. Daily Update: This module keeps track of the amount of milk sold and keeps a record of milk bought on per customer basis.

3. Bill Generation: Now that we have stored the information of customers and also the amount of milk bought by them, this                         
                    module comes into picture and its function is to display the bill of the customer according to their name                     
                    and date range. 

4. Bill Collection: This module displays the name of all the customers who have not paid the bill in a dropdown list and                           
                    display the start date and end date and the amount to be paid which can be manually selected and paid to                       
                    the milkman.

5. Customer Detail: This module provides various options to access the information about a customer based on name, locality,                       
                    if they buy cow or buffalo milk or both. This can help the milkman search a particular customer easily.

6. Payment History: This module deals with the task of displaying the status of payment meaning that it tells if the customer                     
                    has paid the bill or not and the display of records is done on the basis of name and a range of date.

7. Bill Watcher: This module keeps the record of all the customers and display them on the basis of two group wheather the                      
                 customer has paid the bill in full or has some pending amount to be settled.
